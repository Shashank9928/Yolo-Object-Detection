> ## YOLO (version 3) :-

- Making the custom trained model using the YOLO algorithm.

  
> ## Instructions:-

- Use google colab to perform tasks.

- Upload this notebook in colab performs all tasks then download the notebook.

- upload it here with proper commit.

  

> ## Task: -

- Use algorithm present in function **make_yolov3_model()** to make model.

- After making the model train it using data.

- After that tune model for better accuracy.

- Check the accuracy of the model using the evaluations parameters and methods.
  
- User **Tensorboard** to visualize the model's performance.

- Dumb the well-trained model in **h5** format using.

```python

model.save('model/yolov3.h5')

```
